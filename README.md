Requirements:

* only has been tested on Mac OSX
* requires Chrome installation (I think it will automatically install chrome if you don't have it installed already)
* Python3, and pip3

Installation:

```bash
# create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv
# activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate
# install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Running:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

For now the input filename ("burnaby.yaml") and output filename ("out/signs.pdf") are hardcoded, will clean up later
